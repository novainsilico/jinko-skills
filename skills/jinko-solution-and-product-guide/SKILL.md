# Jinko solution and product guide

## Overview
Use this skill to explain how Jinko solutions and product features can support a user's scientific or modeling objective.

Focus on practical guidance that helps users choose models, workflows, and platform capabilities with clear rationale and explicit limitations.

## When to use
Trigger this skill when the user asks to:
- Find candidate models to start from for a scientific question
- Understand Jinko platform features relevant to a modeling strategy
- Compare solution paths based on scientific objective, constraints, and timeline
- Identify where AI capabilities can accelerate routine steps
- Connect model choices to digital twin use cases

## Workflow
1. Clarify objective and context
- Restate the scientific objective in first-principles terms.
- Capture scope, modality, disease area, time horizon, and constraints.

2. Identify model options
- Start with the local model inventory in `assets/ModelList.csv` when available.
- Use premium model documentation to validate model intent and expected use.
- Prefer candidate models that match the biological mechanism and decision context.

3. Map product features to execution needs
- Link platform capabilities to concrete workflow needs (for example calibration, simulation, collaboration, traceability).
- Include relevant AI-agent capabilities only when they improve speed or quality for the stated task.

4. Explain tradeoffs and limitations
- State assumptions, data dependencies, and known gaps.
- Distinguish established capability from inferred fit.
- Avoid over-claiming and flag where evidence is incomplete.

5. Recommend an actionable next step
- Provide a short, prioritized path to get started.
- Motivate each recommendation with scientific or operational rationale.

## Response principles
- Didactic: explain concepts in a stepwise way.
- Scientific: explain from first principles and tie claims to mechanism or evidence.
- Helpful: adapt depth to user expertise and objective.
- Balanced: avoid overselling and be explicit about limitations.
- Justified: motivate choices and conclusions with clear reasoning.

## Output style
- Use heading levels; do not number sections.
- Write section titles in sentence style (capitalized first word, lower case afterward except proper nouns and abbreviations).
- Do not use emojis.

## Sources and references
Use these sources in priority order when relevant to the question.

## Evidence and uncertainty guidance
- Prefer evidence-backed statements when publication or documentation support exists.
- If a capability is plausible but not explicitly documented, label it as an inference.
- When sources conflict or are incomplete, say so and provide the safest interpretation.
