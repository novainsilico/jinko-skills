description: >-
  Build or edit a Jinkō computational model (QSP/PK-PD) via the jinko-sdk: parameters, categorical parameters, compartments, species, ODEs, reactions, dosing events, algebraic rules, baseline checks, solving options, units, and component tags. Use this skill whenever the user wants to create a model from scratch, create an empty model, edit an existing model, add or modify components, apply input/source/output tags, configure unit checking, define model-level dosing events, validate diagnostics, or debug model sanity or simple_solve errors. Prefer editing existing models over recreating them. Do not use this skill for running trials; use jinko-trial for trial execution.
compatibility: >-
  Check set-up with the `jinko-sdk-setup` skill. Model creation/editing requires write access to the Jinkō project.

# Jinkō Model SDK Workflows

Use this skill for technical model construction and editing through the SDK. Keep the scope on SDK mechanics and model validity, not biological plausibility. Initialize the connection with `jinko-sdk-setup` first.

> **PREREQUISITE:** This skill needs an initialized `jinko-sdk` connection and an
> SDK satisfying its `metadata.requires_sdk` range. Run the `jinko-sdk-setup` skill
> (`../jinko-sdk-setup/SKILL.md`) and proceed only once its check passes. If that
> skill is not found, install it from `novainsilico/jinko-skills`.

## Required Workflow

1. If a model was already supplied, prefer editing it over creating a new one. Create one only when needed, in a dedicated folder, with `client.create_empty_model()`.
2. Retrieve the model, inspect its components, tags, units, solving options, and diagnostics before proposing edits. Inspect the unit-checking mode with `model.get_unit_check()`.
3. Set the unit-checking mode with `model.set_unit_check("UnitCheckAndConvertAllSpeciesToExtentUnits")`. Do not select another mode unless a human explicitly directs it after the consequences are explained.
4. Give every directly declared numeric value a unit: numeric parameter formulas, compartment volumes, and species initial conditions. A parameter whose value is derived from an expression may omit its declared unit when the expression determines it. Validate non-trivial units against `references/units_static_info.json` and diagnostics.
5. Attach the built-in platform tags before considering the model complete:
   - `i::vpop` for inputs that vary across virtual patients.
   - `i::protocol` for inputs that vary across protocol arms or scenarios, including the dose amount, first dose time, dose interval, and number of doses of a dosing event.
   - One evidence-backed source tag for each applicable value-bearing input: `s::knowledge`, `s::arbitrary`, or `s::to-calibrate`. Leave an uncertain input untagged and report it for review. Never assign `s::calibrated` during construction; it records an accepted calibration result.
   - `output` for important time-series outputs to plot or calibrate against.

   Three of these decide whether the model is usable downstream, so check them
   across the whole model, not only per component. At least one component must
   carry `output`, or nothing can be plotted, measured, or calibrated against:
   treat its absence as an error. No component carrying `i::protocol` means the
   model cannot be given protocol arms, and none carrying `i::vpop` means it
   cannot vary across virtual patients: report each as a warning, correct only
   for a model meant to be single-arm and deterministic.
   `python -m jinko.cli.validate_model_readiness --model-sid cm-...` runs these
   three checks by default.
6. Attach a traceability link to every value-bearing input tagged `s::knowledge`. Prefer, in this order: the Extract that holds the value, the Reference that holds the Extract, then any other project item that produced the value. Use an external DOI or URL only when the project holds no such item, and report every external link for review. Use the `jinko-reference` skill to upload a missing source and to create its extracts in a dedicated literature subfolder before you link.
7. Optionally attach scientific scoped tags for model navigation and visualization:
   - `granularity::*` for biological or spatial scale; tag color `#0cd95e`.
   - `phenomenon::*` for the represented physical or biological process; tag color `#f87171`.
   - `module::*` for an implemented mechanism or submodel; tag color `#66c09c`.
   - `readout::*` for observation level; tag color `#da1d1d`.

   Use confirmed component definitions and source evidence. Preserve existing
   tags; leave unsupported classifications unassigned. These custom tags are
   not readiness requirements. Read [scientific scoped tags](references/scientific-scoped-tags.md)
   for selection rules and the QSP, PBPK, and PK/PD example catalog.
   Pass the family color to `model.create_tag(..., color=...)`; use
   `tag.set_color(...)` when aligning an existing declaration. Tag-family colors
   are separate from graph component-type colors.
8. Use high-level SDK methods and `model.components.batch(version="...")` for related component changes. The platform tags above already exist; do not recreate them. Create declarations only for other, custom tags.
9. Re-fetch the model, require no error diagnostics, and run `simple_solve()` for representative `output` components. For events, verify the expected pre-/post-event change.

Use `scripts/create_minimal_model.py`, and the SDK's `python -m jinko.cli.tag_model_components` and `python -m jinko.cli.validate_model_readiness`, rather than long ad-hoc snippets. Scripts are dry-run by default and mutate only with `--apply`.

For transparent ISO 8601 duration conversions, use `from jinko.iso8601 import Duration`, for example `Duration.parse("P1M").to_timedelta()`. Solving times accept `timedelta` or ISO strings: `model.set_solving_times(t_max=timedelta(days=28), t_step="P1D", additional_periods=[{"t_max": "P7D", "t_step": timedelta(hours=1)}])`.

## Reference Routing

- Read `references/model-components.md` for component batching, tags, events, formulas, and algebraic rules.
- Read `references/unit_docs.md` for unit semantics and conversion behavior.
- Read `references/model-validation.md` for diagnostics and readiness checks.
- Read `references/scientific-scoped-tags.md` when selecting optional scale, phenomenon, module, or readout tags. It includes a broad, extensible catalog of QSP, PBPK, and PK/PD examples.
